One option is to implement a logarithm in the FPGA, much like we did in the [baseband AGC notebook](1_Baseband_AGC). However, since we only have a 6-bit control for this amplifier, we will simply make a look-up table to map our digital control to appropriate $V_c$ values."

Note that we're using more than 6 bits on the input because of the logarithmic nature of the output --- using 6 bits at the input would result in many of the possible output words being unoccupied. In maths speak, it'd be non-injective and non-surjective. In practice it appears that our 12 bit address is enough to at least make this a surjective function."
