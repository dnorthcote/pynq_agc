Configuring two of these thresholds allows us to observe if our signal of interest is within a given range, while filtering our short dips within a single packet. If a sample is above our range, we will get immediate feedback. Then we know that the analog gain should be decreased, to protect the ADC and prevent saturation. Conversely, only after N (again, this is programmable) samples are below the lower threshold, we will get feedback that the analogue gain should be increased, increasing the SNR after the ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our threshold information is only binary, we cannot tell how far from the ideal gain we currently are. Therefore we have settle for a _linear_ response. We will linearly decrease the gain if the signal is too high, or linearly decrease the gain if the signal is too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "A circuit for this is a simple up/down counter, controlled by interpreting the threshold flags.\n",
